## MIT 6.1810 — Operating System Engineering (Fall 2025)

This repository contains my solutions to the laboratory assignments of [MIT’s 6.1810 – Operating System Engineering course (Fall 2025)](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2025/schedule.html).

The course focuses on the design and implementation of operating systems, and their role as a foundation for systems programming. Key topics include:

- Kernel design
- Hardware/software interaction
- Interrupts and system calls
- Virtual memory
- Threads and context switching
- File systems
- Interprocess communication and synchronization

Throughout the course, xv6, a simple multi-processor operating system for RISC-V, is used to illustrate these concepts. The labs involve extending xv6 with features such as advanced virtual memory mechanisms and networking support.

### Labs

At the end of each chapter there are some labs. Labs per chapter are availble on the same branches;.

1. Lab 1 (Introduction to xv6): Unix Utilities 

	Built some Unix-like utilities
	
	**Branch**: [util](https://github.com/TawalMc/MIT-6.1810Fall2025-xv6/tree/util)

2. Lab 2 (OS Design): System Calls
	
	Implemention of system call
	
	**Branch**: [syscall](https://github.com/TawalMc/MIT-6.1810Fall2025-xv6/tree/syscall)

3. In progress

---
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.
